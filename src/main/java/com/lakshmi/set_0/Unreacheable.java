	// In case 1 : since the variables c, d are declared as non final. 
	// So, the value of these variables can be changed in the program. 
	// JVM thinks that at any point of time there is a chance that the change the value of a and b, and the last statement may be executed, so no error.
	
	// In case 2 : since the variables a, b are declared as final. 
	// So, the value of these variables can not be changed throughout the life cycle of the program no condition will be approached to come out of the while loop. 
	// This in turn makes the second statement unreachable i.e. jvm canï¿½t reach to that statement during program life cycle
